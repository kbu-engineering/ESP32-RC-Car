This is a repository for the ESP32 Rescue Robot project with example code that can be built upon.

Tank controls in these examples refer to using the left joystick for forward and back movement when stick is tilted up/down. Right joystick is used to rotate the car clockwise and anti-clockwise when tilted left/right.

Servo controls include using the trigger button R2 to rotate 180 and then L2 to go back to 0.
